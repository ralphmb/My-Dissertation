In this project we hope to examine generalised linear regression models and see how they can be applied to data from the English Premier League. \
We will first look at logistic regression models, to see how match result is affected by a few different effects. Logistic regression can be used to model Bernoulli processes with variable probability dependent on different factors, making it a useful tool for predicting outcome in sports. \
Afterwards we will look at proportional hazards models and see how they can be used for analysis of first-goal times. Proportional hazards models that we hope to focus on are parametric models of exponential or Weibull type, and the Cox proportional-hazards model. \

All code pertaining to statistics was written in R, though some helper scripts were written in Python. All relevant code will be in the appendices, and some time after the Turnitin check all source files will be uploaded to my Github: #link("https://github.com/ralphmb")
